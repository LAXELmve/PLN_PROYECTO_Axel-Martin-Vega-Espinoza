       "      <td>Every live action anime that I've briefly seen has been nothing short of a disaster, and considering how many times Netflix tried to bring Anime's to life I thought One Piece was about to receive the same fate. But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is bar none one of the best live-action adaptions to any animated source material I have ever seen. I have been a diehard One Piece fan since I was a preteen; it was one of the first manga I ever read and I still watch it to this day. Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, \"Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .\"\\n\\nBut lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.\\n\\nI will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.\\n\\nFor first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium.

I've never heard of One Piece anime, in fact I'm not into anime at all. But this, this was a complete experience, it is bloody addictive.\\n\\nThe main characters optimism & acceptance of others pursuing their dreams regardless of whether or not he agrees with them or indeed they're the dreams of his enemies is a thing of beauty. The kids attitude to his fellow man is admirable & his attitude toward pursuing his own life should serve as a lesson to us all.\\n\\nThe other characters come together nicely too, each different but each with unique problems & gifts - they gel nicely.\\n\\nI can't put my finger on why I loved this show, I just did. It's quirky, it's violent, it's gentle, it's about battles, friendships, dreams, courage, fear & loyalty, & all of it done meaningfully.\\n\\nIt's also beautiful to look at.\\n\\nI hope there is a season 2. It deserves to continue.\\n\\nBravo 👏  \n",
       "2                                               Every live action anime that I've briefly seen has been nothing short of a disaster, and considering how many times Netflix tried to bring Anime's to life I thought One Piece was about to receive the same fate. But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.  \n",
       "3  This is bar none one of the best live-action adaptions to any animated source material I have ever seen. I have been a diehard One Piece fan since I was a preteen; it was one of the first manga I ever read and I still watch it to this day. Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, \"Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .\"\\n\\nBut lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.\\n\\nI will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.\\n\\nFor first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium. Please give it a chance.  \n",

The Live Adaptation is way beyond my expectations and I seriously cried and laughed along every emotional and comforting moment. NETFLIX PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 2. The portrayal of Monkey D Luffy was perfect as well as other characters. Every Episode had its own main character and the introduction to each and every straw pirate crew was done with utmost respect and love 💕. Can't wait for more pirate crew members to be introduced in the later seasons especially Nico Robin.  \n",

Etc Make it happen Netflix! You should be working on Chopper, looking for Robin, Ace, and Vivi... The cast is great, and the locations and CGI are on point! The small changes are OK, and it does not feel like forced. The chemistry is natural, and the scripts are well made.... as Oda-san said \"This is good and can be better\", I will watch this several times and with the different dubs! ENJOY NAKAMAS!!  \n",

I wasn't terribly interested, but decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did! I enjoyed most of the Witcher (played the games as well), but in all honesty, this show is just more entertaining (yes, i realize a different genre but i was thrilled for the witcher series). The characters, especially Buggy (the clown), are well acted, fights scenes different and action-packed, and the cgi is rather good...that sea dragon should be in GoT or House of the Dragon! Now i have a fun show where i can kickback and relax, discuss the show with my kids, and now i'm a slightly intrigued about the game/anime. Thanks netflix, season 2 please!  \n",

I am a new fan of One Piece anime and I had only seem as few of the episodes when I heard that Netflix was releasing a live action of One Piece.\\n\\nAs I watched the first few episodes I could see that they had stuck closely to the source material. I got more and more excited with each episode.\\n\\nEverything is awesome! All the actors are incredible. Each one embodies his or her character as if it was written for them. I especially love Iñaki Godoy, the actor who plays Monkey D. Luffy self proclaimed \"King of the Pirates\".

The setting is fantastical but the show makes it effortlessly understandable and relatable.\\n\\nThe second is the characters. The characters here are mostly tropes but they're so likeable and well-realized by the performers that you can't help getting invested in them.\\n\\nThe third is the sense of light-hearted positivity that pervades the series. It touches on some pretty dark issues but the show and its irrepressibly-optimistic protagonist always have a positive outlook. People's faith in one another is actually rewarded rather than being mocked or denigrated. Image that in 2023.  \n",

I've been watching and reading onepiece for 20 years and this series so represents the spirit of this work that I love so much. I was very happy with the result!\\n\\nAnd I have to say , Honestly, the best live action anime adaptation I've ever seen. This is coming from someone who loves One Piece. So, I was looking for reasons to criticise it, and there are some flaws.. but there were also things this series improved on the original. Overall, I you all should watch it , totally recommend it. Its a great! Lets go season 2!!!!  "

The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away.

I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted.

The story is engaging and good, and it's good to watch with your family members. Highly recommended.\\n\\nOverall, its a good adaptation! I was shocked to find myself smiling whenever Godoy's Luffy comes on screen first episode and onward. The casting director did a fantastic job on finding actors to fit the characters as well as, the rest of the supporting cast! The subtle details they've added were a lovely touch to show they truly did their research. Even with the new changes they did, still feels like one piece at the end just in a different format. I didn't put it a full 10 star because there is always room for improvement! Honestly, felt I was a kid again when I discovered one piece watching this, and falling in love with the characters.</td>\n",

It easily outshines the mediocre anime adaptation that often fail to do justice to the source material. It's the second-best way to immerse yourself in the captivating world of One Piece, right after the original manga. The series flawlessly captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece, delivering a phenomenal experience. With its exceptional storytelling, rich character development, and meticulous attention to detail, it caters to both newcomers and die-hard fans alike. Whether you're new to the Grand Line or a seasoned pirate aficionado, this show is a treasure trove of entertainment that should not be missed. Now, some might complain about the changes they made such as introducing characters early into the series that normally wouldn't come until future arcs and a few others, but I say those people are f#%king nerds and who gives a sh#$.

       "      <td>I recently dived (no pun intended) into the world of One Piece anime and manga which I had avoided for years due to its length. However, once I gave it a chance, I found myself falling in love with Eiichiro Oda's characters, plot, themes, and the expansive world he created. When I first heard about the live-action adaptation, I was skeptical and expected it to be a failure. Despite my doubts, my heart hoped for its success, even though adapting such a complex source material seemed nearly impossible. One Piece, compared to other popular anime, is not an obvious choice for a successful live-action adaptation.\\n\\nTo my pleasant surprise, I couldn't have been more wrong. This live-action version took a unique approach, yet it managed to capture the essence and heart of the original material. It evoked the feelings of hope, passion, and genuine friendship that we all cherish. The emotional impact and plot twists were delivered effectively, and the character backstories added depth to each member of the cast. The actors, especially the Straw Hat crew, displayed excellent chemistry and did justice to their respective characters. The villains, with Buggy being a standout, were exemplary in their portrayals.\\n\\nSome might argue that the emotional impact was less than that of the anime, possibly because the anime delivered these moments first, somewhat diminishing their impact in the live-action adaptation. Additionally, there were those who disliked the idea of a live-action adaptation from the beginning, making it challenging for them to appreciate it. It can be difficult to overcome such preconceived notions.\\n\\nHowever, as a fan of both anime and TV series, I wholeheartedly recommend the One Piece live-action adaptation. You can truly sense the the heart of the entire team, from the production crew to the cast, in bringing this project to life. After a long, exhausting week at the start of the school year, I am grateful to have a series like this to provide a much-needed mental break and relief from exhaustion. Thank you, Oda, for creating this wonderful thing and for giving me even more reasons to fall deeper in love with your work.\\n\\nPS: Emily Rudd , you are so beautiful as Nami! I am simping for you the whole time! HAHA\\n\\nNow watch it!\\n\\nRating: 9.5/10.</td>\n",

I'm really not a big fan of anime. Then after watching the trailers for this I thought it looked like a show for children. I was wrong. I kept reading about how good this show is and how it's #1 on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a show where people of all ages can enjoy. If you can just turn off your brain and watch I promise you'll have a good time. If you're looking for a new show to binge then give One Piece a try. You won't be disappointed!   \n",

I've never heard of One Piece anime, in fact I'm not into anime at all. But this, this was a complete experience, it is bloody addictive.\\n\\nThe main characters optimism & acceptance of others pursuing their dreams regardless of whether or not he agrees with them or indeed they're the dreams of his enemies is a thing of beauty. The kids attitude to his fellow man is admirable & his attitude toward pursuing his own life should serve as a lesson to us all.\\n\\nThe other characters come together nicely too, each different but each with unique problems & gifts - they gel nicely.\\n\\nI can't put my finger on why I loved this show, I just did. It's quirky, it's violent, it's gentle, it's about battles, friendships, dreams, courage, fear & loyalty, & all of it done meaningfully.\\n\\nIt's also beautiful to look at.\\n\\nI hope there is a season 2. It deserves to continue.\\n\\nBravo 👏   \n",

But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.   \n",

I have been a diehard One Piece fan since I was a preteen; it was one of the first manga I ever read and I still watch it to this day. Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, \"Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .\"\\n\\nBut lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.\\n\\nI will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.\\n\\nFor first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium. Please give it a chance.   \n",

The Live Adaptation is way beyond my expectations and I seriously cried and laughed along every emotional and comforting moment. NETFLIX PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 2. The portrayal of Monkey D Luffy was perfect as well as other characters. Every Episode had its own main character and the introduction to each and every straw pirate crew was done with utmost respect and love 💕. Can't wait for more pirate crew members to be introduced in the later seasons especially Nico Robin.   \n",

An attempt that will likely end up in failure in almost every single case, even when the crew and producers care about it.\\n\\nOne piece is a rare exception. A gold nugget. Something I haven't seen since Lord of the Rings. If you are a fan of the original manga today is a day of celebration. Call a couple of friends, buy a giant pizza and go watch it together in the biggest screen you can find.\\n\\nTalk about managing expectations ;).\\n\\nEnjoy!   \n",

We want 2nd season!!!\\n\\nThe series makes several references to the anime. We have in some moments the instrumental of the opening song of the anime. The story is engaging and good, and it's good to watch with your family members. Highly recommended.\\n\\nOverall, its a good adaptation! I was shocked to find myself smiling whenever Godoy's Luffy comes on screen first episode and onward. The casting director did a fantastic job on finding actors to fit the characters as well as, the rest of the supporting cast! The subtle details they've added were a lovely touch to show they truly did their research. Even with the new changes they did, still feels like one piece at the end just in a different format. I didn't put it a full 10 star because there is always room for improvement! Honestly, felt I was a kid again when I discovered one piece watching this, and falling in love with the characters.   \n",

This show is a must-watch, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. It easily outshines the mediocre anime adaptation that often fail to do justice to the source material. It's the second-best way to immerse yourself in the captivating world of One Piece, right after the original manga. The series flawlessly captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece, delivering a phenomenal experience. With its exceptional storytelling, rich character development, and meticulous attention to detail, it caters to both newcomers and die-hard fans alike. Whether you're new to the Grand Line or a seasoned pirate aficionado, this show is a treasure trove of entertainment that should not be missed. Now, some might complain about the changes they made such as introducing characters early into the series that normally wouldn't come until future arcs and a few others, but I say those people are f#%king nerds and who gives a sh#$. So set sail on this epic adventure and discover why it's an absolute triumph.   \n",
       "876  I recently dived (no pun intended) into the world of One Piece anime and manga which I had avoided for years due to its length. However, once I gave it a chance, I found myself falling in love with Eiichiro Oda's characters, plot, themes, and the expansive world he created. When I first heard about the live-action adaptation, I was skeptical and expected it to be a failure. Despite my doubts, my heart hoped for its success, even though adapting such a complex source material seemed nearly impossible. One Piece, compared to other popular anime, is not an obvious choice for a successful live-action adaptation.\\n\\nTo my pleasant surprise, I couldn't have been more wrong. This live-action version took a unique approach, yet it managed to capture the essence and heart of the original material. It evoked the feelings of hope, passion, and genuine friendship that we all cherish. The emotional impact and plot twists were delivered effectively, and the character backstories added depth to each member of the cast. The actors, especially the Straw Hat crew, displayed excellent chemistry and did justice to their respective characters. The villains, with Buggy being a standout, were exemplary in their portrayals.\\n\\nSome might argue that the emotional impact was less than that of the anime, possibly because the anime delivered these moments first, somewhat diminishing their impact in the live-action adaptation. Additionally, there were those who disliked the idea of a live-action adaptation from the beginning, making it challenging for them to appreciate it. It can be difficult to overcome such preconceived notions.\\n\\nHowever, as a fan of both anime and TV series, I wholeheartedly recommend the One Piece live-action adaptation. You can truly sense the the heart of the entire team, from the production crew to the cast, in bringing this project to life. After a long, exhausting week at the start of the school year, I am grateful to have a series like this to provide a much-needed mental break and relief from exhaustion. Thank you, Oda, for creating this wonderful thing and for giving me even more reasons to fall deeper in love with your work.\\n\\nPS: Emily Rudd , you are so beautiful as Nami! I am simping for you the whole time! HAHA\\n\\nNow watch it!\\n\\nRating: 9.5/10.   \n",

Although there are some changes and I think those are due to limitation of adapting diversed story of ONE PIECE. I loved how they casted actor fit the role. It may sound funny to those who have been watching ONE PIECE anime in japanese because of english language but it not bad.i think it will be the great for those who want are not anime fan. Overall it loved it and has my full support.\\n\\n. .\\n\\n. .\\n\\n. .\\n\\n. .\\n\\nP.s I also want support it because I want lot of arc to be adapted or else they might cancel it.so I advice all to watch ONE PEICE great adaptation, okay than ..sayonara....   \n",

But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.</td>\n",

Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, \"Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .\"\\n\\nBut lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.\\n\\nI will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.\\n\\nFor first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium. Please give it a chance.</td>\n",

I was shocked to find myself smiling whenever Godoy's Luffy comes on screen first episode and onward. The casting director did a fantastic job on finding actors to fit the characters as well as, the rest of the supporting cast! The subtle details they've added were a lovely touch to show they truly did their research. Even with the new changes they did, still feels like one piece at the end just in a different format. I didn't put it a full 10 star because there is always room for improvement!

The series flawlessly captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece, delivering a phenomenal experience.

Whether you're new to the Grand Line or a seasoned pirate aficionado, this show is a treasure trove of entertainment that should not be missed.

       "      <td>I recently dived (no pun intended) into the world of One Piece anime and manga which I had avoided for years due to its length. However, once I gave it a chance, I found myself falling in love with Eiichiro Oda's characters, plot, themes, and the expansive world he created. When I first heard about the live-action adaptation, I was skeptical and expected it to be a failure. Despite my doubts, my heart hoped for its success, even though adapting such a complex source material seemed nearly impossible. One Piece, compared to other popular anime, is not an obvious choice for a successful live-action adaptation.\\n\\nTo my pleasant surprise, I couldn't have been more wrong. This live-action version took a unique approach, yet it managed to capture the essence and heart of the original material. It evoked the feelings of hope, passion, and genuine friendship that we all cherish. The emotional impact and plot twists were delivered effectively, and the character backstories added depth to each member of the cast. The actors, especially the Straw Hat crew, displayed excellent chemistry and did justice to their respective characters. The villains, with Buggy being a standout, were exemplary in their portrayals.\\n\\nSome might argue that the emotional impact was less than that of the anime, possibly because the anime delivered these moments first, somewhat diminishing their impact in the live-action adaptation. Additionally, there were those who disliked the idea of a live-action adaptation from the beginning, making it challenging for them to appreciate it. It can be difficult to overcome such preconceived notions.\\n\\nHowever, as a fan of both anime and TV series, I wholeheartedly recommend the One Piece live-action adaptation. You can truly sense the the heart of the entire team, from the production crew to the cast, in bringing this project to life. After a long, exhausting week at the start of the school year, I am grateful to have a series like this to provide a much-needed mental break and relief from exhaustion. Thank you, Oda, for creating this wonderful thing and for giving me even more reasons to fall deeper in love with your work.\\n\\nPS: Emily Rudd , you are so beautiful as Nami! I am simping for you the whole time! HAHA\\n\\nNow watch it!\\n\\nRating: 9.5/10.</td>\n",

I'm really not a big fan of anime. Then after watching the trailers for this I thought it looked like a show for children. I was wrong. I kept reading about how good this show is and how it's #1 on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a show where people of all ages can enjoy. If you can just turn off your brain and watch I promise you'll have a good time. If you're looking for a new show to binge then give One Piece a try. You won't be disappointed!   \n",

I've never heard of One Piece anime, in fact I'm not into anime at all. But this, this was a complete experience, it is bloody addictive.\\n\\nThe main characters optimism & acceptance of others pursuing their dreams regardless of whether or not he agrees with them or indeed they're the dreams of his enemies is a thing of beauty. The kids attitude to his fellow man is admirable & his attitude toward pursuing his own life should serve as a lesson to us all.\\n\\nThe other characters come together nicely too, each different but each with unique problems & gifts - they gel nicely.\\n\\nI can't put my finger on why I loved this show, I just did. It's quirky, it's violent, it's gentle, it's about battles, friendships, dreams, courage, fear & loyalty, & all of it done meaningfully.\\n\\nIt's also beautiful to look at.\\n\\nI hope there is a season 2. It deserves to continue.\\n\\nBravo 👏   \n",

But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.   \n",

I have been a diehard One Piece fan since I was a preteen; it was one of the first manga I ever read and I still watch it to this day. Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, \"Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .\"\\n\\nBut lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.\\n\\nI will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.\\n\\nFor first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium. Please give it a chance.   \n",

The Live Adaptation is way beyond my expectations and I seriously cried and laughed along every emotional and comforting moment. NETFLIX PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 2. The portrayal of Monkey D Luffy was perfect as well as other characters. Every Episode had its own main character and the introduction to each and every straw pirate crew was done with utmost respect and love 💕. Can't wait for more pirate crew members to be introduced in the later seasons especially Nico Robin.   \n",

An attempt that will likely end up in failure in almost every single case, even when the crew and producers care about it.\\n\\nOne piece is a rare exception. A gold nugget. Something I haven't seen since Lord of the Rings. If you are a fan of the original manga today is a day of celebration. Call a couple of friends, buy a giant pizza and go watch it together in the biggest screen you can find.\\n\\nTalk about managing expectations ;).\\n\\nEnjoy!   \n",

We want 2nd season!!!\\n\\nThe series makes several references to the anime. We have in some moments the instrumental of the opening song of the anime. The story is engaging and good, and it's good to watch with your family members. Highly recommended.\\n\\nOverall, its a good adaptation! I was shocked to find myself smiling whenever Godoy's Luffy comes on screen first episode and onward. The casting director did a fantastic job on finding actors to fit the characters as well as, the rest of the supporting cast! The subtle details they've added were a lovely touch to show they truly did their research. Even with the new changes they did, still feels like one piece at the end just in a different format. I didn't put it a full 10 star because there is always room for improvement! Honestly, felt I was a kid again when I discovered one piece watching this, and falling in love with the characters.   \n",

This show is a must-watch, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. It easily outshines the mediocre anime adaptation that often fail to do justice to the source material. It's the second-best way to immerse yourself in the captivating world of One Piece, right after the original manga. The series flawlessly captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece, delivering a phenomenal experience. With its exceptional storytelling, rich character development, and meticulous attention to detail, it caters to both newcomers and die-hard fans alike. Whether you're new to the Grand Line or a seasoned pirate aficionado, this show is a treasure trove of entertainment that should not be missed. Now, some might complain about the changes they made such as introducing characters early into the series that normally wouldn't come until future arcs and a few others, but I say those people are f#%king nerds and who gives a sh#$. So set sail on this epic adventure and discover why it's an absolute triumph.   \n",
       "876  I recently dived (no pun intended) into the world of One Piece anime and manga which I had avoided for years due to its length. However, once I gave it a chance, I found myself falling in love with Eiichiro Oda's characters, plot, themes, and the expansive world he created. When I first heard about the live-action adaptation, I was skeptical and expected it to be a failure. Despite my doubts, my heart hoped for its success, even though adapting such a complex source material seemed nearly impossible. One Piece, compared to other popular anime, is not an obvious choice for a successful live-action adaptation.\\n\\nTo my pleasant surprise, I couldn't have been more wrong. This live-action version took a unique approach, yet it managed to capture the essence and heart of the original material. It evoked the feelings of hope, passion, and genuine friendship that we all cherish. The emotional impact and plot twists were delivered effectively, and the character backstories added depth to each member of the cast. The actors, especially the Straw Hat crew, displayed excellent chemistry and did justice to their respective characters. The villains, with Buggy being a standout, were exemplary in their portrayals.\\n\\nSome might argue that the emotional impact was less than that of the anime, possibly because the anime delivered these moments first, somewhat diminishing their impact in the live-action adaptation. Additionally, there were those who disliked the idea of a live-action adaptation from the beginning, making it challenging for them to appreciate it. It can be difficult to overcome such preconceived notions.\\n\\nHowever, as a fan of both anime and TV series, I wholeheartedly recommend the One Piece live-action adaptation. You can truly sense the the heart of the entire team, from the production crew to the cast, in bringing this project to life. After a long, exhausting week at the start of the school year, I am grateful to have a series like this to provide a much-needed mental break and relief from exhaustion. Thank you, Oda, for creating this wonderful thing and for giving me even more reasons to fall deeper in love with your work.\\n\\nPS: Emily Rudd , you are so beautiful as Nami! I am simping for you the whole time! HAHA\\n\\nNow watch it!\\n\\nRating: 9.5/10.   \n",

Although there are some changes and I think those are due to limitation of adapting diversed story of ONE PIECE. I loved how they casted actor fit the role. It may sound funny to those who have been watching ONE PIECE anime in japanese because of english language but it not bad.i think it will be the great for those who want are not anime fan. Overall it loved it and has my full support.\\n\\n. .\\n\\n. .\\n\\n. .\\n\\n. .\\n\\nP.s I also want support it because I want lot of arc to be adapted or else they might cancel it.so I advice all to watch ONE PEICE great adaptation, okay than ..sayonara....   \n",

But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.</td>\n",

I have been a diehard One Piece fan since I was a preteen; it was one of the first manga I ever read and I still watch it to this day. Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, \"Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .\"\\n\\nBut lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.\\n\\nI will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more \"human\" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.\\n\\nFor first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium.

I'm really not a big fan of anime. Then after watching the trailers for this I thought it looked like a show for children. I was wrong. I kept reading about how good this show is and how it's #1 on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a show where people of all ages can enjoy. If you can just turn off your brain and watch I promise you'll have a good time. If you're looking for a new show to binge then give One Piece a try. You won't be disappointed!   \n",

I've never heard of One Piece anime, in fact I'm not into anime at all. But this, this was a complete experience, it is bloody addictive.\\n\\nThe main characters optimism & acceptance of others pursuing their dreams regardless of whether or not he agrees with them or indeed they're the dreams of his enemies is a thing of beauty. The kids attitude to his fellow man is admirable & his attitude toward pursuing his own life should serve as a lesson to us all.\\n\\nThe other characters come together nicely too, each different but each with unique problems & gifts - they gel nicely.\\n\\nI can't put my finger on why I loved this show, I just did. It's quirky, it's violent, it's gentle, it's about battles, friendships, dreams, courage, fear & loyalty, & all of it done meaningfully.\\n\\nIt's also beautiful to look at.\\n\\nI hope there is a season 2. It deserves to continue.\\n\\nBravo 👏   \n",
       "2                                               Every live action anime that I've briefly seen has been nothing short of a disaster, and considering how many times Netflix tried to bring Anime's to life I thought One Piece was about to receive the same fate. But to my surprise I was wrong.\\n\\nJust 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.\\n\\nIñaki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.\\n\\nAnd as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.\\n\\nI wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.\\n\\nIt's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.   \n",

Can't wait for more pirate crew members to be introduced in the later seasons especially Nico Robin.   \n",
